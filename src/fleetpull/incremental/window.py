"""The half-open watermark resume window — the canonical internal fetch window.

A pure, stdlib-only leaf beside the cursors (DESIGN §4). ``DateWindow`` is the
*resume value* a watermark fetch is built from, distinct from the stored
``DateWatermark`` cursor: the cursor records the maximum event timestamp seen, and
the window is what the resume resolver derives from it (``watermark - lookback`` up
to the trailing edge). A fetch is built from the window, never from the watermark
directly.

The window is half-open, ``[start, end)`` — start inclusive, end exclusive — and
that is the canonical internal form: the half-open boundary is what lets storage's
delete-by-window predicate (``>= start & < end``) and the start-anchored
append-filter share one rule, so a cross-boundary event is never double-counted at
a window edge (DESIGN §4). Unlike the pure ``cursor.py`` carriers, ``DateWindow``
enforces one structural invariant on construction — ``start < end`` — because that
ordering has no downstream enforcement; UTC validity, which does (the codec
boundary), is deferred there exactly as ``DateWatermark`` defers it.

    The half-open ``[start, end)`` watermark resume window.

    The resume value the spec-builder turns into a request, distinct from the
    stored ``DateWatermark`` cursor — a fetch is built from this window, not from
    the watermark. Half-open by definition: ``start`` inclusive, ``end`` exclusive.
    The half-open boundary is the canonical internal convention that lets the
    delete-by-window predicate and the start-anchored append-filter share one rule
    (DESIGN §4); there is deliberately no ``contains`` / ``__contains__`` —
    membership is storage's vectorized Polars ``>= start & < end``, never scalar
    row-level.

    Construction enforces the one structural invariant, ``start < end`` (strict,
    well-ordered, mirroring the run ledger's window). It lives here on the type,
    not deferred like ``DateWatermark``'s UTC check, because the ordering has no
    downstream boundary to catch it — an inverted or empty window is a loud-failure
    bug, not a value to carry; the resume resolver returns ``None`` for a caught-up
    ``start >= end`` rather than constructing one, so this invariant now backstops a
    direct construction bug. UTC validity is not checked here; it crosses the codec
    boundary when a spec-builder serializes the bounds, and that boundary raises on
    naive/non-UTC, exactly as for ``DateWatermark``.

    Attributes:
        start: The window's inclusive start, timezone-aware UTC.
        end: The window's exclusive end, timezone-aware UTC; must be after
            ``start``.
